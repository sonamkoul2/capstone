# robot_motion_planning
- This project is about a robot mouse tasked with plotting a path from a corner of a maze to its center. 
- The goal of this project is to implement a robot mouse module to map out a maze and find the center and figure out
the best paths to the center on the first run. On the second run, the robot attempts to reach the center in the fastest time possible, using the paths it has previously learnt.
