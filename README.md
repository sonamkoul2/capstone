# robot_motion_planning

- This project is about a robot mouse tasked with plotting a path from a corner of a maze to its center.

- The goal of this project is to implement a robot mouse module to map out a maze and find the center and figure out
the best paths to the center on the first run. On the second run, the robot attempts to reach the center in the fastest time possible, using the paths it has previously learnt.

- The reason for doing this project is to get acquainted to mapping out a mobile environment, represented by the maze or grid cells and to find the fastest way between any two locations.

- You should learn best artificial intelligence algorithms for mobile robot's tracking its positions, orientations, motions for smart moves decision making process. 

### * Tools:

- This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

- To run the tester, you can do so from the command line with a command like the following: 
- python tester.py test_maze_01.txt

- The syntax on command line for maze visualization is as follow: python showmaze.py test_maze_01.txt
